lines --> 

    a program that expects exactly one command-line argument, 
    the name (or path) of a Python file, and outputs the number of lines of code in that file, excluding comments and blank lines.       
    If the user does not specify exactly one command-line argument, or if the specified file’s name does not end in .py, or if the specified file does not exist, 
    the program should instead exit via sys.exit with a message. Any line that starts with # is a comment.

    and outputs a table formatted as ASCII art using tabulate. Format the table using the library’s grid format. 
    If the user does not specify exactly one command-line argument, or if the specified file’s name does not end in .csv, or if the specified file does not exist, 
    the program exits via sys.exit.

scourgify --> 

    a program that expects the user to provide two command-line arguments:
      - the name of an existing CSV file to read as input, whose columns are assumed to be, in order, name and house, and
      - the name of a new CSV to write as output, whose columns should be, in order, first, last, and house.
      - Converts that input to that output, splitting each name into a first name and last name. each student will have both a first name and last name.            
    If the user does not provide exactly two command-line arguments, or if the first cannot be read, the program exits via sys.exit with an error message.

      -in sys.argv[2], the name (or path) of a JPEG or PNG to write (i.e., save) as output
      -The program should then overlay shirt.png (which has a transparent background) on the input after resizing and cropping the input to be the same size, 
      saving the result as its output.

numb3rs --> 

    a program to check IPv4 address format, using regular expressions.
    function called validate expects an IPv4 address as input as a str and then returns True or False, respectively, if that input is a valid IPv4 address or not.
    
  test_numb3rs.py checks the validate function

response -->

    a program that prompts the user for an email address via input and then prints Valid or Invalid, respectively, if the input is a syntatically valid email address. 
    does not validate whether the email address’s domain name actually exists, using regular expressions.

![image](https://github.com/AtaGo28/Introduction-to-Programming-with-Python-Problem-Sets/assets/94257930/240cb644-5ee7-447b-9c9f-b3a3f26ded55)



um -->

    a program to count "um" word, using regular expressions.
    function called count expects a line of text as input as a str and returns, as an int, the number of times that “um” appears in that text, case-insensitively, 
    as a word unto itself, not as a substring of some other word. 
    For instance, given text like hello, um, world, the function returns 1. Given text like yummy, though, the function returns 0.

  test_um.py checks the count function.

watch -->

    a program to extract youtube link out of a video from iframe src, using regular expressions.
    function called parse that expects a str of HTML as input, extracts any YouTube URL that’s the value of a src attribute of an iframe element therein, 
    and returns its shorter, shareable youtu.be equivalent as a str. Expect that any such URL will be in one of the formats below. 
    Assuming the value of src will be surrounded by double quotes. And assume that the input will contain no more than one such URL. 
    If the input does not contain any such URL at all, return None.

working -->

    a program to convert 12 hour format timespan to 24 hour format timespan, using regular expressions.
    function called convert that expects a str in either of the 12-hour formats below and returns the corresponding str in 24-hour format (i.e., 9:00 to 17:00). 
    Expect that AM and PM will be capitalized (with no periods therein) and that there will be a space before each. 
    Assume that these times are representative of actual times, not necessarily 9:00 AM and 5:00 PM specifically.

    9:00 AM to 5:00 PM
    9 AM to 5 PM

    Raises a ValueError instead if the input to convert is not in either of those formats or if either time is invalid (e.g., 12:60 AM, 13:00 PM, etc.). 
    But does not assume that someone’s hours will start ante meridiem and end post meridiem; someone might work late and even long hours (e.g., 5:00 PM to 9:00 AM).

  test_working.py checks the convert function.

jar -->

    a class called Jar with these methods:

    -  __init__ should initialize a cookie jar with the given capacity, which represents the maximum number of cookies that can fit in the cookie jar. 
    If capacity is not a non-negative int, though, __init__ should instead raise a ValueError.
    -  __str__ should return a str with n 🍪, where n is the number of cookies in the cookie jar. 
    For instance, if there are 3 cookies in the cookie jar, then str should return "🍪🍪🍪"
    -  deposit should add n cookies to the cookie jar. If adding that many would exceed the cookie jar’s capacity, though, deposit should instead raise a ValueError.
    -  withdraw should remove n cookies from the cookie jar. Nom nom nom. 
    If there aren’t that many cookies in the cookie jar, though, withdraw should instead raise a ValueError.
    -  capacity should return the cookie jar’s capacity.
    -  size should return the number of cookies actually in the cookie jar, initially 0.

  test_jar.py tests the jar class

seasons -->

    a program that prompts the user for their date of birth in YYYY-MM-DD format and then sings prints how old they are in minutes, 
    rounded to the nearest integer, using English words instead of numerals, just like the song from Rent, without any and between words. 
    Since a user might not know the time at which they were born, for simplicity, that the user was born at midnight (i.e., 00:00:00) on that date. 
    And assume that the current time is also midnight. In other words, even if the user runs the program at noon, assuming that it’s actually midnight, on the same date.

  test_seasons.py tests the test_minutes and test_text_minutes functions.
